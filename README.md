2. Install the OpenAI API client by running `pip install openai` in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the `chatbot.py` file with your actual API key.
4. Run `python chatbot.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

## Usage

Type a message into the console and the chatbot will respond with a generated message.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot's behavior by modifying the `generate_response` function in the `chatbot.py` file. You can also experiment with different OpenAI language models and parameters to generate different responses.
